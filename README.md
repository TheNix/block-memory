# Block Memory
Simple (but amazing!) memory game about clicking off boxes in the right order. Revolutionary game play mechanics.

Alternative name: Random Block Memory (RMB). [Play game here](http://tinybits.dk/labs/rbm)

### Todo
* Blocks are not actually randomized, that's just a gimmick for now.
* New game mode: Time trial. Time starts from 60 seconds and ticks down. Every right guess adds time.
* Levels of increasing complexity.
* Localstorage to save user high scores.
* Online high scores, so you can compete with friends! Who wouldn't want to do that?
* Share buttons. Let's make this baby go viral!

### ETA
The plan is to launch a Kickstarter and get it Greenlit on Steam, and release it as as "Early Access" soon after.
After a series of missed deadlines, and a prolonged period of radio silence, the game will be plunged into a v1.0, even though none of the promised features are implemented, and the core game is broken.
Instead of resolving the fundamental issues, the course of action would be to add new graphical DLCs. It's also vital that the player should somehow be able to purchase hats and other in-game cosmetics.
